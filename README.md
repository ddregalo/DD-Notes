# Notes app

### Description
Build a notes app as a frontend, single page web app. You'll be guided through this by the high-level challenges listed below. However, there will be no walkthroughs.

To get an idea of what you'll be building, here are some user stories and a mockup for the notes app. (This is just to give you an idea of the app. You'll work through the challenges below to build it.)

### Challenges

"Spike" means writing code without writing tests. "TDD" means develop test first.

TDD a model for a note
TDD a model for a list of notes
TDD a note list view
Spike to create and serve an index.html page for your app
Spike code that inserts some HTML into the index.html page
Spike and then TDD code that shows a note in the index.html page
TDD a single note view
Use TDD to show only the first 20 characters of each note on the main note list page
Use TDD to finish the implementation of a single note page
Spike adding a form to index.html for creating a note
Spike to intercept a form submit event emitted by the create note form
Spike to extract note text from a form submit event
Use TDD to finish support for user note creation
Refactor
Extract a standalone test library

### User Stories

```
As a programmer
I can see a list of my notes, where each note is abbreviated to the first 20 characters
So I can find the one I want
```

```
As a programmer
I can create a new note
So I can record something I need to remember
```

```
As a programmer
I can see the full text of an individual note on its own page
So I can see all the information in the note
```

(NB: notes do not need to be permanently stored.  If the user refreshes their web page, they'll lose their notes, and that's fine.)
